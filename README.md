The Unlikely Squad
A 2D stealth-puzzle platformer where you switch between a team of bizarre heroes to save the day!

"The Unlikely Squad" is a single-level prototype game inspired by real-time tactics games like Shadow Tactics and Commandos, reimagined as a 2D platformer. The core mechanic is switching between four unique characters on the fly, using their distinct abilities in synergy to overcome obstacles, solve puzzles, and navigate the level.

Gameplay
The objective is to guide the squad through a level filled with puzzles that can only be solved by specific characters. You control one hero at a time, but can instantly switch to another, maintaining your position on the map. Careful planning and creative use of your squad's powers are key to reaching the goal.

Abilities:

Abilities:

Micro Shift: Can shrink to the size of a cockroach to fit through tiny passages.
